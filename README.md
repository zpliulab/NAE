# NAE: Evaluating gene regulatory network activity from dynamic expression data by regularized constraint programming #


**To evaluate the activity of regulatory events in the form of network, we propose a network activity evaluation (NAE) framework by measuring the consistency between network architecture and gene expression data across specific states based on mathematical programming.**

-
- MATLAB R2022a (requires Parallel Computing Toolbox installed)

The core interface function of NAE is code\refer_NAE.m

    [newgra,obj,opt] = refer_NAE(data,network,Lp,parameter);

where *data* represents the gene expression profile of the time series; *network* is the network to be evaluated; *Lp* represents the norm type used; *parameter* is a structure, where parameter.i is the regularization parameter that must be set. The return value *newgra* is the inference network, *obj* is the loss value generated by each iteration, and *opt* is the parameter used.
